# Firedeb-Desktop-Live-ISO
These are LiveCDs of Firedeb that might not work. These ISOS will be based on the bleeding edge of my firedeb-desktop.


Instructions:

1. Download the latest release here:https://github.com/dgrtygry/Firedeb-Desktop-Live-ISO/releases. You need to look for the file labled "mini.iso".

2. Plug in a flash drive and open a terminal and type in "sudo dd if=/home/admini/Downloads/mini.iso of=/dev/sda bs=1m" without the quotation marks.

3. Reboot your PC and go to your bootmenu. (Some computer models have different boot keys).

4. Go to the debian grub and select "Expert install" and follow the instructions on the installer.

5. When prompted to, Reboot and enjoy your desktop!
